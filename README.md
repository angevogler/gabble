Use Express and Sequelize to build a social network for students. This network, called "Gabble," has users, public messages, and likes.

Users should:
- have a username and password for logging in
- have a display name

Messages should:
- be associated with a user who wrote them
- have up to 140 characters of text

Likes should:
- be associated with a user who made the like and a message that was liked

The application should have ways to do the following:
- Sign up as a new user
- Log in
- Log out
- View all messages with the newest first
- Create a new message
- Delete one of your own messages
- Like a message
- See who liked a message
